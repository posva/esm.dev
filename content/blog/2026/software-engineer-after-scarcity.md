# Software Engineers After Scarcity

For most of modern history, software engineers were scarce for a simple reason. **Writing code was hard.**

That constraint shaped careers, salaries, and company structures. If you could reliably turn ideas into working software, you had leverage.

That era is fading.

AI did not just make engineers faster. It changed **what is scarce**.

And scarcity, not effort, is what determines value.

## Code Is No Longer the Bottleneck

AI has pushed code toward commodity status.
Not because it produces perfect software, but because it produces usable software instantly.

That changes the math.

- Raw execution speed matters less
- “I can build it” is no longer a moat
- Shipping more code does not reliably increase income

This is why many senior engineers feel unsettled right now.
They are more productive than ever, and less sure how that productivity turns into leverage.

That discomfort is a signal.

## From Builders to Decision Holders

When intelligence becomes cheap, **judgment becomes expensive**.

Engineers used to be valued for:

- syntax fluency
- framework expertise
- implementation speed

Those skills still matter. They are no longer the differentiator. They are the baseline.

What is becoming scarce instead is the ability to decide:

- what should exist
- which constraints matter
- where the real risks are
- who owns the consequences when something breaks

In practice, this pulls engineers closer to authority, not just execution.

## “People Will Just Ask AI” Is Only Half True

Yes, people will ask AI for answers.

But asking is cheap.
**Acting is not.**

The moment an action:

- involves real money
- carries legal or regulatory risk
- affects customers
- creates irreversible outcomes

you need more than a generated response. You need structure, traceability, and accountability.

That gap is where software still matters.

As AI improves, institutions do not loosen controls. They tighten them. When systems become more powerful, the cost of being wrong increases.

## Software Becomes a Boundary

Increasingly, software is not about features. It is about **permissioned execution**.

It exists to answer questions like:

- Who is allowed to do this?
- Under what conditions?
- With what guarantees?
- Who is responsible if it goes wrong?

AI can suggest.
Software decides what is allowed to happen.

That is why engineering does not disappear. It moves up the stack.

## What This Means for Engineers

A few uncomfortable realities:

1. **Pure execution roles shrink**
   If your primary value is “I implement features,” you are competing with AI-assisted everyone.

2. **Responsibility becomes leverage**
   Engineers who can own outcomes, not just code, gain pricing power.

3. **Money follows risk absorption**
   People do not pay for intelligence.
   They pay to reduce risk, compress critical timelines, and sleep better at night.

The highest-value engineers will be those who:

- design systems with real constraints
- integrate AI into workflows safely
- are trusted as the final human in the loop

## The Reframe That Matters

The question used to be:

> “How do I build this?”

Increasingly, it becomes:

> “Who already pays for this pain, and what am I willing to be responsible for?”

That shift is uncomfortable because it is not purely technical.
It is also where engineers stop being interchangeable and regain leverage.
