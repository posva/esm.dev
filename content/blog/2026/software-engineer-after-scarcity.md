# Software Engineers After Scarcity

For most of modern history, software engineers were scarce because **writing code was hard**. That era is ending.

AI didn’t just make us faster. It changed **what is scarce**.

And scarcity—not effort—determines value.

## Code Is No Longer the Bottleneck

AI has turned code into a commodity.
Not because it writes perfect programs, but because it writes _good enough code instantly_.

As a result:

- Execution speed is no longer a differentiator
- “I can build it” stopped being a competitive advantage
- Output volume stopped correlating with income

This is why many senior engineers feel paradoxical right now:
**More productive than ever, less certain how to monetize it.**

That feeling is accurate.

## The Shift: From Builders to Decision Holders

When intelligence becomes cheap, **judgment becomes expensive**.

Software engineers are no longer primarily valued for:

- syntax mastery
- framework knowledge
- implementation speed

Those are now table stakes.

The new center of gravity is:

- deciding _what_ should exist
- defining _constraints_ under which systems operate
- owning consequences when things go wrong

In other words: engineers move closer to **authority**, not just execution.

## Why “People Will Just Ask AI” Is Only Half True

Yes—people will ask AI directly.

But asking is free.
**Acting is not.**

Any action that:

- carries legal risk
- touches real money
- affects customers
- triggers irreversible consequences

cannot be safely delegated to a general-purpose AI without structure, auditability, and accountability.

That gap is where software still matters.

As AI gets better, institutions don’t relax controls—they tighten them.
The cost of being wrong goes up.

## Software Stops Being a Product and Becomes a Boundary

The future of software is not apps—it’s **permissioned execution**.

Software increasingly exists to answer questions like:

- Who is allowed to do this?
- Under what conditions?
- With what guarantees?
- Who is responsible?

AI generates suggestions.
Software authorizes actions.

This is why engineering doesn’t disappear—it **moves up the stack**.

## What This Means for Software Engineers

Three uncomfortable truths:

1. **Pure execution roles shrink**
   If your value is “I implement features,” you are competing with AI-assisted everyone.

2. **Responsibility becomes leverage**
   Engineers who can own outcomes—not just code—gain pricing power.

3. **Money follows risk absorption**
   People don’t pay for intelligence.
   They pay to reduce risk, save time in critical paths, and sleep at night.

The highest-value engineers will be those who:

- design systems with constraints
- integrate AI safely into real workflows
- are trusted to be the last human in the loop

## The Reframing That Matters

The future software engineer is less:

> “How do I build this?”

And more:

> “Who already pays for this pain—and what am I allowed to take responsibility for?”

That shift is uncomfortable because it’s not purely technical.
But it’s also where software engineers regain leverage.
