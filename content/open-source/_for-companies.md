There aren't many companies sponsoring Open Source developers, but there are **even less companies not using Open Source**.

> But why would a company sponsor the Open Source they use?

This is a great question! Here are **my top reasons**:

- [_Sustainability_]{.bg-gradient-to-r.dark:from-emerald-300.from-emerald-700.to-emerald-500.dark:to-emerald-200.bg-clip-text.text-transparent.font-bold}: Sponsoring me allows me to spend less time searching new clients and more time **improving the tools you use**.
- [_Reliability_]{.bg-gradient-to-r.dark:from-red-500.from-red-900.to-red-500.dark:to-red-200.bg-clip-text.text-transparent.font-bold}: **I have been contributing to the Vue.js ecosystem since 2015**. I have a proven track record of maintaining my libraries and helping the community.
- [_Exposure_]{.bg-gradient-to-r.dark:from-purple-300.from-purple-700.to-purple-500.dark:to-purple-200.bg-clip-text.text-transparent.font-bold}: Developers will know your company is **supporting the tools they use** increasing your brand awareness, odds of hiring, and overall reputation.

On top of that, I can offer you Freelancing services if you **fund my work** [💰]{.wiggle}. **Even [$50]{.font-mono.font-thin} per month goes a long way**. Check the options below [👇]{.handshake}

- ~~[🤝]{.handshake} **One Time help**: :cal-schedule-button - Schedule a call together so I can provide personalized assistance.~~
- [❤️]{.heartbeat} **Small sponsorship**: Sponsor me on :chip-link{text="GitHub Sponsors" icon="bxl:github" url="https://github.com/sponsors/posva"} with small amounts like [$50]{.font-mono}. It does not require anything from your side and **help me a lot**.
- ~~[<Icon name="pepicons-pop:arrows-spin" />]{.spin.reverse} **Recurring help**: Let's setup a contract. Similar to GitHub Sponsor but adapted to companies who value good practices and well-maintained code bases.~~

ℹ️ Since I am currently full-time employed, I can no longer offer freelancing contracts and consultancy.
