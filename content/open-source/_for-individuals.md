I make open-source to share patterns I think are efficient and help others, no matter if they make money out of it or not. **I have been coding for fun since I was a kid**, and I like to share my passion with others. If you are an individual and want to support my work, you can do so by becoming a supporter. _Any_ amount will be greatly appreciated [❤️]{.heartbeat}. The simplest way to do so is by :chip-link{text="sponsoring me on GitHub" icon="bxl:github" url="https://github.com/sponsors/posva"}.

> Can I book a call with you as an individual?

A few years ago I was able to spend a lot of time helping out in issues and forum but as life goes on and responsibilities grow, I have less and less time to do so.
**Yes, you can book a call as an individual**. Though the prices are only targeted to companies so it might be a bit expensive for individuals.
