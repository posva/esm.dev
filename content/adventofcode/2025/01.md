# Day 1: Secret Entrance

## Part 1

### Sample input

```
L68
L30
R48
L5
R60
L55
L1
L99
R14
L82
```

Following these rotations would cause the dial to move as follows:

The dial starts by pointing at 50.
The dial is rotated L68 to point at 82.
The dial is rotated L30 to point at 52.
The dial is rotated R48 to point at 0.
The dial is rotated L5 to point at 95.
The dial is rotated R60 to point at 55.
The dial is rotated L55 to point at 0.
The dial is rotated L1 to point at 99.
The dial is rotated L99 to point at 0.
The dial is rotated R14 to point at 14.
The dial is rotated L82 to point at 32.
Because the dial points at 0 a total of three times during this process, the password in this example is 3.

### Solution

[- Input](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1/input)

```ts
function countZeros(positions: string[]): number {
  let totalZeros = 0
  let currentPosition = 50

  for (const move of positions) {
    const direction = move[0]
    const distance = parseInt(move.slice(1), 10)

    if (direction === 'L') {
      currentPosition -= distance
      currentPosition = currentPosition % 100
      if (currentPosition === 0) {
        totalZeros++
      }
    } else if (direction === 'R') {
      currentPosition += distance
      currentPosition = currentPosition % 100
      if (currentPosition === 0) {
        totalZeros++
      }
    }
  }

  return totalZeros
}
```

## Part 2

Same as part one, but instead of doing it at the end of each turn, we have to count every single click. So if we have error 22, we have to turn 22 times and each time check if you have zero.

```ts
function countZerosDetailed(positions: string[]): number {
  let totalZeros = 0
  let currentPosition = 50

  for (const move of positions) {
    const direction = move[0]
    const distance = parseInt(move.slice(1), 10)

    for (let i = 0; i < distance; i++) {
      if (direction === 'L') {
        currentPosition--
        if (currentPosition < 0) {
          currentPosition = 99
        }
      } else if (direction === 'R') {
        currentPosition++
        if (currentPosition > 99) {
          currentPosition = 0
        }
      }

      if (currentPosition === 0) {
        totalZeros++
      }
    }
  }

  return totalZeros
}
```
