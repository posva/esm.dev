# Day 2: Cube Conundrum

## Part 1

```
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
```

> In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.
>
> The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?
>
> In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.

### Solution

- [Input](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2/input)

```js
var input = document.body.textContent

var max = {
  red: 12,
  green: 13,
  blue: 14,
}

var games = input
  .trim() // remove empty line at the end
  .split('\n')
  .map((game) => {
    const [gameId, sets] = game.split(':')

    return {
      id: +gameId.slice(4).trim(),
      sets: sets
        .trim()
        .split(';')
        .map((cubes) =>
          cubes
            .trim()
            .split(',')
            .map((cube) => cube.trim().split(' '))
        ),
    }
  })

var count = 0 // possible games

for (const { id, sets } of games) {
  let valid = true
  console.log(`Checking game ${id}: ${sets.join(' | ')}...`)

  for (const set of sets) {
    const remaining = { ...max }
    if (!valid) {
      break
    }
    for (const cubes of set) {
      if (!valid) {
        break
      }
      const [count, color] = cubes
      // debugger
      remaining[color] -= +count

      if (remaining[color] < 0) {
        valid = false
      }
    }
  }

  console.log(`--> ${valid ? 'possible' : 'impossible'}`)
  if (valid) {
    count += id
  }
}

console.log(count)
```
