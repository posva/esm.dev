# Day 7: Camel Cards

## Part 1

### Instructions

> Hands are primarily ordered based on type; for example, every full house is stronger than any three of a kind.
>
> If two hands have the same type, a second ordering rule takes effect. Start by comparing the first card in each hand. If these cards are different, the hand with the stronger first card is considered stronger. If the first card in each hand have the same label, however, then move on to considering the second card in each hand. If they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins; otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then the fifth.
>
> So, 33332 and 2AAAA are both four of a kind hands, but 33332 is stronger because its first card is stronger. Similarly, 77888 and 77788 are both a full house, but 77888 is stronger because its third card is stronger (and both hands have the same first and second card).
>
> To play Camel Cards, you are given a list of hands and their corresponding bid (your puzzle input). For example:
>
> ```
> 32T3K 765
> T55J5 684
> KK677 28
> KTJJT 220
> QQQJA 483
> ```
>
> This example shows five hands; each hand is followed by its bid amount. Each hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its rank, where the weakest hand gets rank 1, the second-weakest hand gets rank 2, and so on up to the strongest hand. Because there are five hands in this example, the strongest hand will have rank 5 and its bid will be multiplied by 5.
>
> So, the first step is to put the hands in order of strength:
>
> - 32T3K is the only one pair and the other hands are all a stronger type, so it gets rank 1.
> - KK677 and KTJJT are both two pair. Their first cards both have the same label, but the second card of KK677 is stronger (K vs T), so KTJJT gets rank 2 and KK677 gets rank 3.
> - T55J5 and QQQJA are both three of a kind. QQQJA has a stronger first card, so it gets rank 5 and T55J5 gets rank 4.
>
> Now, you can determine the total winnings of this set of hands by adding up the result of multiplying each hand's bid with its rank (765 _ 1 + 220 _ 2 + 28 _ 3 + 684 _ 4 + 483 \* 5). So the total winnings in this example are 6440.

### Solution

```js
const input = document.body.textContent.trim()

function getCardValue(card) {
  switch (card) {
    case 'T':
      return 10
    case 'J':
      return 11
    case 'Q':
      return 12
    case 'K':
      return 13
    case 'A':
      return 14
    default:
      return parseInt(card)
  }
}

function getHandValue(hand) {
  const cards = hand.split('')
  if (cards.every((c) => c === hand[0])) {
    return 7
  }

  cards.sort()
  hand = cards.join('')

  if (hand.match(/(.)\1{3}/)) {
    return 6
  }

  // full house
  if (hand.match(/(.)\1{2}(.)\2{1}/) || hand.match(/(.)\1{1}(.)\2{2}/)) {
    return 5
  }

  // triple
  if (hand.match(/(.)\1{2}/)) {
    return 4
  }

  // double pair
  if (hand.match(/(.)\1[^\1\2]?(.)\2/)) {
    return 3
  }

  if (hand.match(/(.)\1/)) {
    return 2
  }

  return 1
}

var sorted = input
  .split('\n')
  .map((line) => line.split(' '))
  .sort((a, b) => {
    const [aHand, aBid] = a
    const [bHand, bBid] = b

    const aRank = getHandValue(aHand)
    const bRank = getHandValue(bHand)

    console.log(`‚ô£Ô∏è ${aHand} ${aRank} | ${bHand} ${bRank}`)

    if (aRank !== bRank) {
      return aRank - bRank
    }

    console.log('---')
    for (let i = 0; i < aHand.length; i++) {
      const aCards = getCardValue(aHand[i])
      const bCards = getCardValue(bHand[i])
      console.log(`üÇ† ${aHand[i]} ${aCards} | ${bHand[i]} ${bCards}`)
      if (aCards !== bCards) {
        return aCards - bCards
      }
    }

    return 0
  })

var total = sorted.reduce((total, [hand, bid], i) => {
  return total + bid * (i + 1)
}, 0)

console.log(total)
```

## Part 2

### Instructions

> To make things a little more interesting, the Elf introduces one additional rule. Now, J cards are jokers - wildcards that can act like whatever card would make the hand the strongest type possible.
>
> To balance this, J cards are now the weakest individual cards, weaker even than 2. The other cards stay in the same order: A, K, Q, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, J.
>
> J cards can pretend to be whatever card is best for the purpose of determining hand type; for example, QJJQ2 is now considered four of a kind. However, for the purpose of breaking ties between two hands of the same type, J is always treated as J, not the card it's pretending to be: JKKK2 is weaker than QQQQ2 because J is weaker than Q.

### Solution

```js
const input = document.body.textContent.trim()

function getCardValue(card) {
  switch (card) {
    case 'T':
      return 10
    case 'J':
      // NEW
      return 1
    case 'Q':
      return 12
    case 'K':
      return 13
    case 'A':
      return 14
    default:
      return parseInt(card)
  }
}
```
